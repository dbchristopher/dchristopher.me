	<h3>What is this?</h3>
	<p>
		This is a simple list of all the protein consumed and a note about the sources. What gets
		measured gets managed, and I have found it easier to reach my dietary targets if I write it down
		somewhere. This is not a complete diet journal, as I'm only currently tracking that single
		macro. I'm keeping this data to be public to demonstrate that it doesn't have to be complicated
		to make progress to your own fitness goals.
