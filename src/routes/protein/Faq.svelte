	<h3>What is this?</h3>
	<p>
		This is a simple list of all the protein consume and a note about the sources. What gets
		measured gets managed, and I have found that it's much easier to reach my protein target every
		day if I write it down somewhere. This is not a complete dietary journal, as I'm only currently
		tracking that single macro. I decided to allow this data to be public in case it inspires you to
		also be more proactive in tracking your diet and fitness goals.
