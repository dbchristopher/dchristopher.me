	<h3>What is this?</h3>
	<p>
		This is a simple list of all the protein consume, with the explicit goal of trying to eat 1 gram
		of protein per pound of bodyweight. I created this simple application for fun and simply because
		I got tired of managing a spreadsheet on my phone throughout the day. I don't expect you to be
		all that interested, but I decided to allow this data to be public in case it inspires you to
		also be more proactive in tracking your diet and fitness goals.
